# wtoku-page

This is my secound page in html. I didn't use any framework to do it (same as in my first project). In this case responsiveness is preserved.
It was important to me, to use new techniques and new elements for the first time, to learn how they work and how to use them. Layout of is really nice. 
I think it looks profesional. I'm proud of my secound page. It's good score.

The page is about some speech therapy office.
